# Weight-Management-Analysis
## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing data related to weight management, dietary habits, and exercise trends over a period using the Multi-Timeline dataset. The analysis includes descriptive statistics, data visualization, correlation analysis, and regression modeling to understand the relationships and trends among these variables.

## Data Source
The data for this analysis was sourced from the Multi-Timeline dataset, which tracks weight loss, diet scores, and training intensity across weeks in the United States from March 24, 2019, to March 24, 2024. The dataset contains 262 observations collected weekly.

## Technologies Used
R programming language
Libraries used:
readr for data import
ggplot2 for data visualization
psych for descriptive statistics
corrplot for correlation analysis
lm function for linear regression modeling
## Project Steps
Data Preparation
Data was imported using the readr library and converted into a dataframe for analysis.
Missing values were checked and addressed to ensure data integrity.
The "Week" column was converted to a date format for temporal analysis.
Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics, including mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum, were calculated for weight loss, diet scores, and training intensity using the psych library.
Data Visualization
Line plots were created to visualize trends in weight loss, diet scores, and training intensity over weeks using ggplot2.
Scatter plots were used to explore relationships between variables such as diet vs. training and diet vs. weight loss.
Correlation Analysis
A correlation matrix was computed to examine the relationships between weight loss, diet scores, and training intensity using corrplot.
Regression Modeling
Linear regression analysis was performed to model the relationship between weight loss and predictors such as diet scores and training intensity using the lm function.
Coefficients, standard errors, t-values, and p-values were analyzed to understand the impact of diet and exercise on weight management outcomes.
## Results and Insights
The analysis revealed several key findings:

Weight loss exhibited a positive trend over the years, reflecting growing efforts towards healthier lifestyles.
Training intensity showed a significant positive correlation with weight loss, highlighting the importance of regular physical activity.
Dietary habits had a moderate effect on weight loss, indicating that balanced eating patterns are crucial for sustainable weight management.
Regression analysis confirmed the influence of both diet and exercise on weight loss outcomes, emphasizing the need for a combined approach in weight management strategies.
## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into weight management strategies, emphasizing the role of diet, exercise, and balanced lifestyles in achieving sustainable weight loss. The findings contribute to ongoing efforts in public health interventions aimed at promoting healthier living and well-being.
